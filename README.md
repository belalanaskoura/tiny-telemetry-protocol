Tiny Telemetry Protocol v1 (TTPv1)
===================================

This project simulates a small telemetry system with a client sending sensor data (temperature) to a server, with a GUI for running automated baseline tests. The system tracks packets, calculates checksums, detects duplicates, and logs data in CSV format.

Project Structure
-----------------
**tiny-telemetry-protocol/**
  - **Automation/**
    - `Baseline.py` – Launches server and client, coordinates test
    - `Baseline_GUI.py` – GUI to run baseline automation
  - **Client/**
    - `Client.py` – Simulated telemetry client
  - **Server/**
    - `Server.py` – Telemetry server receiving client data
    - `sensor_data.csv` – CSV log generated by the server
  - **Documents/**
    - **Reports/** – Any project reports or documentation
      - `Project Proposal.pdf`
      - `RFC draft.pdf`
  - `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies
  - `README.md` – This file



Features
--------
- UDP-based client-server telemetry.
- Packet sequence numbers, checksums, duplicate detection, and gap detection.
- Logs sensor data to `sensor_data.csv`.
- GUI to launch tests and display logs.
- Configurable run duration and server IP.
- UDP packets can be tracked in real-time using **Wireshark** for network analysis.

Dependencies
------------
Requires Python 3.10+ and the following libraries:
- pandas
- customtkinter
- tabulate

All dependencies can be installed at once using the included `requirements.txt`.

Setup and Installation
----------------------
1. Clone or download the repository to your computer.
2. Open a terminal in the project folder.
3. (Optional but recommended) Create a virtual environment:
   - Windows:
     python -m venv venv
   - Linux/Mac:
     python3 -m venv venv
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - Windows:
     venv\Scripts\activate
   - Linux/Mac:
     source venv/bin/activate
5. Install all dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

Running the Project
------------------
GUI Version (Recommended):
1. Run the GUI:
   python Baseline_GUI.py
2. Input Fields:
   - Server IP: Leave empty for auto-detection of LAN IP.
   - Run Duration (seconds): How long to run the simulation (default 60s).
3. Click "Run Baseline". The GUI will:
   - Start the server.
   - Start the client.
   - Display live logs.
   - Show sensor_data.csv in a formatted table once finished.

CLI Version (Optional):
1. Run Baseline.py from the command line:
   python Baseline.py <server_ip> <duration>
   - <server_ip>: IP of the server (or leave empty for LAN IP).
   - <duration>: Duration in seconds to run the simulation.

CSV Output
----------
All telemetry data is logged in:
Server/sensor_data.csv

Columns:
- device_id — ID of the client device.
- seq — Packet sequence number.
- timestamp — Unix timestamp of client packet.
- arrival_time — Time the server received the packet.
- duplicate_flag — 1 if duplicate, 0 otherwise.
- gap_flag — 1 if a sequence gap detected, 0 otherwise.
- data_value — Payload value (temperature).

Notes
-----
- Server must run before the client sends data (handled automatically by Baseline.py and GUI).
- Packet loss and duplication are simulated randomly in the client.
- You can adjust simulation behavior in Client.py constants.
- UDP packets can be tracked and analyzed in real-time using **Wireshark** for debugging and inspection.
